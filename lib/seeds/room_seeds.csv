Greenhouse,"A sweet aromatic smell fills the room. Strange and exotic plants are dispersed around a large carnivorous plant specimen. As if sensing your presence, the monstrous carnivorous plant begins to snap large and menacing teeth in your direction. Under one of its leaves you can see the metal glint of a shovel.

Yard,"You're standing on a once-manicured lawn, the dark mansion looming before you, an imposing structure against the night sky. A loud crash makes you turn and you see that the Southern gate has slammed shut behind you. You rattle the gate's bolt, but the dark steel refuses to budge. You will need to find another way off the premises. To the North is the mansion veranda. To the West lies a greenhouse and, in the distance, to the East you see a chapel just beyond a dog kennel. A guttural howling seems to be coming from somewhere nearby.","You're in an open yard and the dark mansion stands before you, imposing against the night sky. The immovable gate stands to your South.

Kennel,"You stumble across the kennel yard, surprising what was once a dog. A zombie beagle is running straight at you. A zombeagle! The creature cannot reach you due to a chain securing it to a kennel that has ""MacK"" written above its entrance. The zombeagle has the appearance of a leper, and is clearly no longer alive. It appears to be guarding the entrance to the graveyard to the North. To the West is the yard.","The zombeagle stares at you, unmoving.

Chapel-south,"Moving forward, you pass four cultists, each dressed in ornamental robes that set them apart from the cultists standing in rows. The moment you step onto the altar, the chanting comes to an immediate stop. In the chilling silence, you peer at the form on the altar. In the flickering candlelight you can make out the nametag on the uniformed body: Tyler. The light from the candles reflects off of the singular key on his keyring.","The chanting has stopped and the figures stand perfectly still. To the North is the exit of the chapel.",0,3,0,,1,1,0,0,0
Security,"Inside the security office, you find a desk poorly lit by a flickering lamp that does not appear to be plugged into anything. Folders are strewn about the table and onto the floor. In the back of the room sits a gun rack with a smashed lock.","You see a desk poorly lit by a flickering lamp that does not appear to be plugged in.

Veranda,"Stepping onto the mansion's enclosed veranda, an imposing door looms to the North of you. To the West you see an office with the words ""Security"" on a board above the door. You can see a large sturdy lock on the West door. To your South is a dark manicured yard.","You are standing on the veranda of the mansion.

Graveyard,"A shallow fog blankets the ground, worn grave markers stand like stone islands in the fogbank. You trip over several broken markers as you move through the boneyard in the dark. One stone in particular, marked by an angel missing a wing, displays the name ""Lady Rebecca Beaumont"". You can hear a foreboding chant coming from the chapel to the East. To the South you can see the dog kennel.","A shallow fog blankets the ground, worn grave markers stand like stone islands in the fogbank.

Chapel-north,"As you open the door to the chapel you can peer down the shadowy aisle to the altar. Candles line the walkway revealing rows of mysterious robed figures.

You can move South toward the altar or West to return to the graveyard.","Candles line the walkway revealing mysterious figures in robes standing in rows.

Kitchen,"After climbing through the secret entrance behind the painting, it falls back into place behind you. As you tumble into the kitchen, a stench assaults your nostrils, redolent of spoiled food. Rusted knives protrude vertically from where they have been stabbed into the counter. Slashed into the cabinets, in a deranged scrawl, are the words ""MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN QUICHE, DAN!"" A door is located to the East.","A stench assaults your nostrils, redolent of spoiled food.

Intake,"You step out of the frigid fog into the mansion proper, you can hear a muted crash of thunder just outside. In front of you there is a reception desk boasting a few notes scattered across its surface. On its front edge, stands a placard with the name ""Kelsey"".

Warden's-Office,"You find yourself in a room with a large imposing desk spanning 15 feet. The unnecessarily large portrait of the warden, which hangs menacingly over the room, appears to be watching you. An antique head-cage is modeled by a faceless mannequin in the corner. The room is eerily quiet, muffling the sounds of its surroundings. You can actually hear a breeze blow the scattered papers across the desk. The breeze, along with the dim light in the room, is coming from the East wall, where an open window looks out onto a small courtyard.","The desk and portrait loom over the eerily quiet room, and the head-caged mannequin lurks in the corner.

Dining-Room,"You are greeted by a pungent smell that sends bile up the back of your throat. A banquet table extends 20 feet across the room, set with china and fine silver. Serving trays bedeck the table, filled with a mold-encrusted feast. This is the source of the rancid smell that fills the room. Numerous portraits surround the room lorded over by a singular image nearly ten feet in height on the South wall. The grand painting is tilted dramatically to one side and has a plaque that reads ""Lord Nathaniel Beaumont 1817-1896."" The floor below the image bears a number of deep scratches.","The pungent smell of the moldy feast has not improved.

Infirmary,"As you enter the infirmary, a smell of decay wafts through the air. A spotless desk in the corner supports an office organizer with stacks of files. In the center of the room a decrepit chair is surrounded by small carts bearing surgical tools. A brick colored stain trails from the chair to the carts and then to the drain in the center of the floor. To the South is a door with a sturdy lock. Upon further inspection, there is a key that has been broken off inside the lock. You will have to find another way to deal with the lock. To the East is a door slightly ajar bearing a plaque stating ""Apothecary"". To the North are the cells of Ward C.","The infirmary remains stained and discomfiting.

Apothecary,"You enter the apothecary. There is a strong smell of stale herbs overlaid with acrid chemicals. Bundles of dried flowers hang from the ceiling and the light from the dim candles reflect off the bottles that line three of the four walls. Upon inspection, the bottle labels tell of bizarre contents: deadly nightshade, frogs breath, a rat foetus, and a monkey's paw. Equipment for mixing chemicals dominate the table along the wall, with a vial of reddish-purple liquid heating slowly over a bunsen burner. Outside the door to the West is the infirmary from which you came.","Disturbing bottles line the walls, and the scents of herbs and chemicals clash in your nostrils.

Apothecary,"You carefully remove the reddish-purple vial from the bunsen burner and pour it into a handy beaker, combining it with the liquid from the fishman's vial. The two liquids mix and create a new yellowish-orange solvent. A stray drop escapes when you seal the new vial and hits the table, hissing as it burns through the metal. This could be useful. You seem to have created a beaker full of acid. The exit to the infirmary is to your West.","Disturbing bottles line the walls, and the scents of herbs and chemicals clash in your nostrils.

Center-Cells,"Prying back the heavy metal door with a loud and jarring screech, you enter the cells of the asylum. The metal bars for the individual cells are damaged and destroyed.  Cloth shreds that may have once been bedding litter the area. You notice a certain stickiness on the floor near the drains. Faint moans and an occasional screech indicate that there might be a few inhabitants creeping around while the less fortunate still rot in their cells. The lights fade into darkness at the West most cells leading into a shadowy corridor. To the East you can hear bereft wailing but are unable to determine the source in the dimly lit conditions. To the South you can return to the common room.","Back in the cells, you step through drifts of shredded cloth, dodging the sticky materials by the drains.

East-Cells,"The wailing grows louder and out of the shadows you can see the apparition of a weeping woman in the corner. Her head turns slowly and she lets out a piercing shriek. She blocks your access to the two doors behind her, one to the East and another to the South. You can return to the cells to the West.","The apparition remains, its gaze locked onto yours.

Baths,"You step inside of the baths to find that someone left the hot water running. Steam fills the air, partially obscuring the greenish tile of the baths.

You notice a vial with a blueish-green substance hanging from a chain around his neck, perhaps the only sign of his human origins.","You step inside of the baths to find that the hot water is still running.
