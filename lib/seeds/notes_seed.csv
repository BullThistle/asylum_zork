intake,"Dammit, Kelsey, stop forgetting the combination to the intake door! I can't always stop what I'm doing to come unlock it for you. Especially right now; I've noticed suspicious sounds from the chapel, and likely have to drive off some vandals again. I've left a copy of the combination on your desk, and if you lose that, I'll see that you lose your job. -Tyler"
apothecary,"Experiment Notes, October 30th - I've made great progress on my current research into acidic compounds. Soon, I should have a formula so potent it can melt away metal in seconds. Unfortunately, some of the chemicals are too volatile to leave near the rest of my supplies. I've stored them in the baths, where spillage would cause the least damage. I'm going to call down to the kitchen again. They're taking their sweet time with my quiche. -Dan"
center-cells,"Records - Patient 314RB: Becca's condition has been deteriorating rapidly, despite our treatments. Her mood remains serene, unless someone tries to take her ring. While it breaks our policy against personal possessions, I believe it best that we make an exception in her case. Her hysterics the last time we removed it disturbed the other patients greatly, and she did not calm until we returned the trinket, a day and a half later."
dining-room,"Page from The History of Beaumont Estate and Asylum: The mansion that now houses the asylum was generous gift towards public health by Lord Beaumont, shortly after the tragic death of his only child. Lady Beaumont herself was the first patient at the asylum, having lost her mind with grief after the child's passing. Lord Beaumont could not bear to remain in the mansion after the tragedy, but Lady Beaumont never left, nor did her gentle and devoted beagle, MacK."
security,"Security Log, November 2nd - At the behest of Doctor Loren, I've acquired another collection of strange supplies. Nets, bait, galoshes, and even a damn harpoon gun (I had to special order that last one). I can't think what he needs them for when we're so far from the sea, but by now I've learned not to ask questions about these things."
greenhouse,"Something has to be done about the state of the greenhouse! One of those damn plants nearly took off my arm today, and I can't reach half my tools. I can't be expected to work in an environment like this! -Woody"
